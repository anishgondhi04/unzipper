RUBRICS

Solution Quality 
----------------
  (10/10) Excellent Solutions
  - Program is complete
  - Algorithm and data structures are appropriate 
     - marks may be deducted for very inefficient solutions
  - Bits are stored compactly and appropriately
  - Bit manipulations are appropriate
  - Variables are properly initialized
  - All tests are passing

  (8/10) Good Solution
  - Program is complete but may have a minor bug
  - Algorithm and data structures are appropriate 
  - Variables are properly initialized
  - Bits are stored compactly and appropriately
  - Bit manipulations are appropriate
  - Nearly all tests are passing

  (6/10) Marginal Solution
  - Implementation has major bugs. (Most tests are not passing)
  - Bits are stored compactly and appropriately
  - Bit manipulations are appropriate
  - Algorithm and data structures are appropriate 

  (4/10) Poor Solution
  - Appropriate approach is used but program is incomplete.
  - Implementation has major flaws.

  (2/10) Very Poor Solution
  - Attempt has been made

-----------------------------------------------------------
Code Clarity
-------------
  (10/10) Professional looking code should be:
  - well commented
  - follows style guidelines
  - consistent formatting
  - is easy to read
  - does not have any function definitions in header files 
    (prototype declarations are ok)

  (8/10) Code looks good if:
  - some comments
  - follows style guidelines
  - consistent formatting
  - is easy to read
  - does not have any function definitions in header files 

  (6/10) Code is mostly readable if
  - somewhat follows style guidelines
  - mostly consistent formatting
  - does not have any function definitions in header files 
  - marker is having difficulty understanding your code

  (4/10) Code is hard to read if
  - follows a few of the guidelines
  - somewhat consistent formatting
  - has function definitions in header files 
  - marker can barely understand your code

  (2/10) Code is illegible
  - code cannot be understood
